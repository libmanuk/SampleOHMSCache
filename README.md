# SampleOHMSCache
A set of sample cachefiles for use with the OHMS Viewer.

After installing the OHMS Viewer, these cachefiles can be placed within the Viewer's tmpDir directory which must be specified in the Viewer's config.ini file.

The reference look like:

tmpDir = /var/www/html/viewerfiles

Note that this be set as either an internal or HTTP path.

Once the tmpDir path is set in your config.ini and these sample files are placed into the tmpDir, links to the sample interviews will look very similar to the following:
